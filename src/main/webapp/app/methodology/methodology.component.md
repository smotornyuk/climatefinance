## Methodology & Assumptions

There is currently no internationally recognised definition of ‘climate change financing’. A common understanding of climate change financing is that it refers to financial flows for ‘mitigation’ and ‘adaptation’ related activities. Furthermore, specific, country-focussed definitions have been utilised where they exist in national policies.

The quantitative analysis utilised in this tool relies on a range of assumptions and methodologies to help quantify the amount and shape of climate change and disaster risk finance received by a country. The tool is based on methodology developed in 2013 for the Pacific Climate Change Finance Assessment Framework [link to report].

The tool draws information from the inputted database of climate change and disaster risk-related projects for each country.

The tool estimates the total volume (as a USD value) of climate change and disaster risk-related expenditure by weighting individual projects. This weighting is undertaken according to the proportion of expenditure considered relevant to CCDRM from a scale of 0-100%.

The guidelines for this weighting system are available in the following table:

## Limitations

A number of limitations are acknowledged, related to the methodology and the functional components of the tracking tool. These include:

* The subjective nature of the weighting process
* The tool currently tracks projects from 2010-2016 for Solomon Islands and from 2014-2016 for Vanuatu. There may be a gap in capturing projects between 2016 and when the tool commenced pilot status in 2020
* The tool captures only climate change finance in the form of grants
* Values in USD have been converted from local currencies utilising an exchange rate at the time the data was entered
* The disbursement feature cannot be utilised with the weighted values. This will measure disbursement of the full project value
* Regional projects are particularly challenging to quantify as country allocations are often not clear and not always made known to national governments. Hence an approximated value is often used
